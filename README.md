A website designed to connect individuals who wish to prepare the event or ceremony like a wedding or birthday, with the appropriate vendor for each service that they will need in that ceremony.
This website will have two sides to log in through; one side is for registering different vendors who provide various ceremony services like venues, catering, photography, sound system, transportation, and many more.
The second login side is for an individual who is preparing for a ceremony or an event and wishes to get connected with appropriate vendors for ceremony services based on the type of ceremony, needed services, location,
and the amount of money that the individual wishes to spend on entire ceremony or event.
after the individual chooses the services, he will need and enters the amount he wishes to spend on the entire ceremony, then the website's system will show him the appropriate vendors for each service he has selected.
